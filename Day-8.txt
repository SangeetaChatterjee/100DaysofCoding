VIEWS are logical tables that are created from actual tables and are used to give restricted view to a tables information to others. Updating a view makes changes to the actual table and should never be used for updating purpose.

FROM sales as a LEFT JOIN customer as b ON
a.customer_id = b.customer_id
ORDER BY a.order_line
